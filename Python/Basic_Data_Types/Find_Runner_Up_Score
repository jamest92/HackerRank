# Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, 
# you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores. 
# Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.

# The first line contains n E.g. 5. The second line contains an array A[i] of integers each separated by a space. E.g. 2 3 6 6 5

# Constraints:
# 2 <= n <= 10
# -100 <= A[i] <= 100
