P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*
Write a query to print the pattern P(20).


One method (MySQL):


SET @number = 21;  
SELECT REPEAT ('* ', @number := @number -1)
FROM information_schema.tables;



notes:
- The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES view allows you to get information about all tables and views within a database. 
By default it will show you this information for every single table and view that is in the database.

-User defined variables start with @ in MYSQL.
:= is an operator that does not require you to use the key word SET before it.
Basically @number := @number - 1 is saying decrease the @number user variable each time it's printed out. 
In pseudocode it would be number = number - 1.

-The function works like that: repeat(string, times)
So, at the beginning we want to repeat the '*' symbol 20 times, but we also want to decrement its value by one in each iteration. That's why we start with 21.
So in the first iteration we apply 21-1=20, and we repeat the '*' symbol 20 times.
In the second we will apply 20-1=19, and we will repeat the '*' symbol 19 times.
